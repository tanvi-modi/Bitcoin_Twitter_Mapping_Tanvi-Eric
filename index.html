        <h1>Bitcoin Popularity in the USA </h1>
        <p> Is bitcoin a new gold rush? Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies have gained momentum in the past decade. During
            thanksgiving
            in 2017, most dinner with family were talking about the new tech fad, "the bitcoin" and how this is the next
            big
            thing. Just after that evryone started investing in bitcoin heavily, only to lose their money by more than 5
            times. It
            fell from 17k to 3k in the next 2 years. Everyone started bashing the concept and the bitcoin miners and
            enthusiasts
            were trolled in twitter almost everyday. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Until 2020 happened, the crypto market entered bull run again, it shattered the
            financial market and all the naysayers. Bitcoin became as valuable as the gold market with trillions of
            market cap. I
            have shown how twitter users are talking about it in the last week with their geo location. The tweets were
            collected
            using the <b>Twitter API</b> with the #bitcoin hashtag having geo information. They were then aggregated
            based on their location using a frequency
            count dictionary. These locations are plotted in the US map with their count as circles, with radius as
            their count
            origination from that specific city. This visualization shows which cities in the US are actively discussion
            about
            bitcoin.

                similar to the above US map. However, here we have curated only the relevant cities which have more
                twitter traffic.
                Accordingly, we can see that most tech hubs in <b>California, Texas, Seattle and financial sectors in
                    New York</b> are shown as
                having high twitter traffic for bitcoin discussion. </p>

        <p> Back in 2010, there were miners who used 5 bitcoins to buy pizzas. it costed less than a dollar and almost
            none talked
            or knew about it. 10 years later, owning 5 to 10 bitcoins would give you generational wealth. Is bitcoin a
            new gold
            rush? Yes, we believe so. The prices have started climbing up to all the high of 20k by late 2020. All the
            financial
            pundits who wrote off crypto as a scam, were regretting not investing in bitcoin and not being the initial
            adapters. Now
            1 bitcoin costs 60k as of March 2021. This shows how the bitcoin popularity soared in the above graph, where
            we have shown
            the price fluctuations starting from September 2020 till March 2021. </p>
